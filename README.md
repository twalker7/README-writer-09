        ## Description: 
        
        An app that produces artwork and drink ingredients at random for the user. The drink display works by receiving a user's input (the type of alcohol they desire to use) and fetching a random drink's name and ingredients, with instructions for putting it together. The other aspect of the app is simply a generator of random art images from the Metropolitan Museum in New York. If the user desires a new drink or artwork result, they can simply re-click the respective button to receive new content.
        
        ## Purpose:
        The purpose of this app is to provide users with an entertainment tool that can be enjoyed by groups of people, especially during periods of isolation like the Covid-19 quarantine

        ## Installation Instructions:
